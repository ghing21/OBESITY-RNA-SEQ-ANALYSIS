## Data Storage and sharing

Create a variable on the .bashrc for these paths as well. They may come handy.

```{r}
data_path <- "/home/projects/exam_2025_22140_22150/group_7"
```

A folder is created at {r}

## Loading functions and provided in the course material

```{r}
# Loads extractGeneCountMatrixFromIsoCounts()
# and loadIsoformCountMatrix()
load(file='/home/projects/22140/exam_data/exam_functions.Rdata')
```

Load isoform data:

```{r}
isoInfo <- read_rds(
  paste0(
    '/home/projects/22140/exam_data/',
    'Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.chr_patch_hapl_scaff_tx_info.Rds'
  )
)

isoInfo
```

```{r}
isoInfo |> loadIsoformCountMatrix()
```
